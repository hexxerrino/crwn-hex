This is the project from one of the courses that I'm doing right now.

Some of the technologies used for the app are react, redux, redux-saga, firebase

You can switch to the styled-components branch to see the app with styled components and redux-saga for handling the async side effects

You can visit the live current version of the app at: https://crwn-hex.herokuapp.com
